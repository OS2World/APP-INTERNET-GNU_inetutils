This directory only contains those parts (patches applied) of the 
GNU inetutils 1.0 that are needed to compile them under OS/2. On how to get 
the whole package and for legal issues read the file ../readme.emx.

These files/directories are not in the original distribution:

        bsd-h                   (FreeBSD /usr/include/arpa/*)
        readme                  (This file)
        std.mk                  (Helper makefile, see there for legal terms)
        headers/emx.h           (Some additional function declarations)
        libinetutils/emx.c      (Some additional functions)

You'll need EMX 0.9b fix 5 and dmake to compile these sources. If you've
got them, do the following:

        cd libinetutils
        dmake -B
        cd ..\libtelnet
        dmake -B
        cd ..\ftp
        dmake -B
        copy ftp.exe ..\..\bin
        cd ..\telnet
        dmake -B
        copy telnet.exe ..\..\bin
        
If you get a *huge* lot of junk upon "dmake -B", use on of the following 
commands instead (using MS-Shell or tcsh from ftp.leo.org or 
ftp-os2.cdrom.com):

        sh -c "dmake -B"
        tcsh -c "dmake -B"

If you get the message "dmake:  dependencies:  line 1:  Error -- Detected 
circular dependency in graph at [...]" when running dmake, simply run it again 
(same command line) until you get no more error messages.

There should be no compiler warnings except in ftp/ruserpass.c, line 100.

To clean up, you can remove all of the following files in all directories:

        *.a
        *.d
        *.o
        _state.mk
        dependencies
