This is the first release of the GNU inetutils 1.0, ported for EMX,
containing ftp and telnet at the moment. There may be bugs and strange
behaviour since it has not been tested very well. Please let me
know if you find anything unusual.

A reason to use these programs instead of those shipped with the IBM
TCP/IP or IAK is that they work with Emacs in special modes (although
this hasn't been tested thoroughly). Also, they are a bit more modern
and include more features.

Regarding the other programs of the GNU inetutils: they will be ported
if my very limited spare time allows and if there's enough interest. 
Anybody is free to get the source themselves and try to port it (I will 
give hints if necessary). If somebody wants to maintain this port in the 
future, I'm glad to let him do it since I cannot guarantee to have enough 
time and resources to do it well; especially I'll not be able to monitor 
the newsgroups for new releases of the inetutils.

The GNU inetutils contain these programs:

        ftp, ftpd, inetd, rcp, rexecd, rlogin, rlogind, rsh,
        rshd, syslog, syslogd, talk, talkd, telnet, telnetd
        tftp, tftpd, uucpd

Only ftp and telnet have been ported for OS/2.

This archive has the executables, man pages and some patches,
which can be applied to ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/inetutils-1.0.tar.gz 
(about 384 KB compressed). It also contains those parts of the source code
which are needed for EMX. To compile the package, EMX 0.9b fix 5 
and dmake are needed, which can be downloaded from ftp-os2.cdrom.com
or ftp.leo.org.

The author of the port is Ekkehard Kraemer (ekraemer@pluto.camelot.de)
